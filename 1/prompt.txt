Act like a technical architecture advisor. I am selecting a database for a new application and need  help to choose the most suitable one based on the requirements listed below. 

Project Requirements: 
1. It's a social platform expected to handle millions of users. 
2. Needs to store user profiles, user posts, and connections (relationships) between users. 
3. Requires high read performance. 
4. Expected 80% read operations and 20% write operations. 
5. Should scale well as the user base grows. 

At the end, suggest a specific type of database that best fit.

Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.
